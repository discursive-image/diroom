You have to install some dependencies to make this work:
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org): for audio transcoding (4.2.2).
- [Go](https://golang.org): for building the dependencies (go1.13.8).
- [redis](https://redis.io) (optional): for caching the image links (999.999.999).

**Disclaimer**: `sgtr` is still proprietary software :-( I hope I'll be allowed to free it soon!
